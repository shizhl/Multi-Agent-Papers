# Papers for LLM-based Agents Collaboration
In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have shown remarkable performance in several existing benchmarks or real-world applications. Nevertheless, they still face difficulties in 
 tackling complex tasks. Inspired by collaborative problem solving, several recent works use the strategy of multi-agent collaboration as a potential solution.

We collect the **Must-read papers** to catch up and share the state-of-the-art methods, facilitating the related research.
