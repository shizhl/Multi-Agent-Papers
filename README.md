# LLM-based-Agent Papers
In the era of large language models (LLMs), the LLM-based agents have shown remarkable performance in several existing benchmarks or real-world applications.

We collect the **Must-read papers** to catch up and share the state-of-the-art methods, facilitating the related research.
